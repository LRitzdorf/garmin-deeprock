# Deep Rock for Garmin

A Deep Rock Galactic watch face for Garmin smartwatches.
Based on @C-D-Lewis's faces for [Fitbit](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/cb09baf4-95ba-4f06-b614-1382495c7b29) ([source](https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/fitbit-dev/tree/master/faces/deeprock)) and [Pebble](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/67def87c122b40000904b4f0) ([source](https://github.com/C-D-Lewis/pebble-dev/tree/master/watchfaces/deep-rock)).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in development for the Vivoactive 3; more devices may be added once that's functional.
